# The data was extracted from that is in represented as the HRS File was from the website of the Health and Retirement Study. 
# It dealth with different froms of data including the BMI of many of the individuals who are documented by thei oragnization. 
# The Data set for this R Script is provided in the same repos. 

#1 Create a histogram of the variable r1bmi in the population to examine its normality
#2 Create a histogram of the variable r1bmi in the population to examine its normality.
#3 Calculate the mean of r1bmi this is the population mean since you pretend the HRS sample as a population.
